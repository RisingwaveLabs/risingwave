          Hey @{{ author }}, this pull request failed to merge and has been
          dequeued from the merge train.  If you believe your PR failed in
          the merge train because of a flaky test, requeue it by clicking
          "Update branch" or pushing an empty commit with 
          `git commit --allow-empty -m "rerun" && git push`.

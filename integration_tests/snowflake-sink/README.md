# Example Use Case: Sinking to Snowflake

this tutorial (and the corresponding examples) aims at showcasing how to sink data to Snowflake in RisingWave.

## 1. Preparation

due to the SaaS nature of snowflake, sinking data to snowflake via risingWave typically has some prerequisites.

for detailed data-pipelining and sinking logic, please refer to the official documentation(s), e.g., [data load with snowpipe overview](https://docs.snowflake.com/user-guide/data-load-snowpipe-rest-overview).

### 1.1 S3 setup

users will need to setup an **external** S3 bucket first, and please make sure you have the corresponding credentials, which will be required **both** in your snowflake stage and risingwave sink creation time.

note: the required credentials including the following, i.e.,
- `snowflake.s3_bucket` (a.k.a. the `URL` in snowflake stage)
- `snowflake.aws_access_key_id` (a.k.a., the `AWS_KEY_ID` in snowflake stage)
- `snowflake.aws_secret_access_key` (a.k.a. the `AWS_SECRET_KEY` in snowflake stage)

### 1.2 Snowflake setup

users will then need to setup the snowflake, which includes, i.e.,
- generate the key-value pair for later authentication
- create a `role` and grant the appropriate permission
- setup the credential for the user (e.g., `RSA_PUBLIC_KEY`), and retrieve the `snowflake.rsa_public_key_fp` which will later be used in risingwave
- create a `table` to store the sink data from risingwave
- create a `stage` to refer the external s3 bucket, which will be used internally by snowflake to load the corresponding data
- create a `pipe` to actual receive loaded data from the pre-defined stage and copy the data to the snowflake table.

ps.
1. this assumes the users have already created their accounts and the corresponding databases in snowflake.
2. for detailed authentication process, refer to [official authentication guide](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/developer-guide/sql-api/authenticating).
3. for detailed commands, refer to [official reference](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/reference)

an example for snowflake setup commands could be checked at `snowflake_prep.sql`, this also corresponds to the following example sinking use case.

## 2. Begin to sink data

launch your risingwave cluster, and execute the following sql commands respectively.

- `create_source.sql`
- `create_mv.sql`
- `create_sink.sql`

note: the column name(s) in your materialized view should be exactly the same as the ones in your pre-defined snowflake table, due to what we specified for snowflake pipe previously in `snowflake_prep.sql`.
